# What We Do 🌍️

## Our modern world is enabling mass child exploitation, and we have to do something about it.

You're indirectly or directly affected by it (possibly even traumatized from it) - everyday, tons of people [send and sell CSAM] while exploiting countless kids with no consequences, with [CSAM](https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/csam), and all kinds of [CE](https://safeguarding.network/content/safeguarding-resources/child-criminal-exploitation/) being enabled and normalized.

Horrible, right? Don't worry, it's only solutions from now on. Let's do something about this together.

## The Project 🎯

We are a small internet group focused on stopping child exploitation with fun and creative methods. The goal is to fill up all of the useless and nasty parts of the internet with eye-opening content like this for people who care about mental health and children. **We will win this battle against evil, we already are.** 
### We're here to share this message in a simple, honest, and life-loving, non corporate way.

### If you have an idea on how we can prevent child sexual abuse, then [[Contact Us \|contact us.]] 

> We need you if you care at all about this. I want you to be a part of this project when we make headlines. We have to change the world, we will, and we are. Please, be a part of this if you have some time to waste. There is hope.

### How We Do It

Finding people online who are wasting time, or who have skills, and asking them to help us, and build their own skill set along the way. (We might have done this with you hopefully)

Then, we try to create something so incredibly beautiful and helpful - So good that it gets shared and is posted everywhere. Through providing links to other amazing and helpful sites, helping survivors of abuse and addiction, giving kindness (even giving some resources to people who have paedophilic thoughts, assuming they have a chance of being human too), building community, and building skills for everyone.

Promoting freedom.
### Unique Systems

The world, and especially these problems are so complex - and we focus on understanding the problem deeply, knowing why things happen, and how they happen, and take simple and achievable steps towards solving the problems on personal, and local levels. - encouraging people who have been affected by this to safely share their stories and share their thoughts for fighting this.
#### Making good use of time

Wouldn't it be awesome if we find people wasting time online, then use that time to make a true impact? We do this through creator collaborations, discord bots, posts everywhere on social media, and just the phrase: "If you have some time to waste, we need you"

We don't put an emphasis on money, since we want to help people escape the dependence on a money driven society, but we do accept donations if someone asks.
#### Offering guides for families to [escape the society](https://www.endce.org/why-be-independent) that causes this CSE pain in the first place.

Here's our doc for "the [problems and solutions for parents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyUqccIRYcNA5nHFql1QAvSDd4M3KfkKqwI1pPiSiDw/edit?usp=sharing)"
#### A skilled team focused on fighting the overall business of CSAM through tech & legal methods.

We have a skilled group of people from when we first started, who have relevant skills - cybersecurity, general tech, law, impact - contributing their knowledge and resources to make research and resource documents for people who are online reporting child sexual abuse - which again, is normalized across social media and the dark web, and is evident by the people we speak to.

Our organization (Daisykorps) is working on understanding the overall tech-based CSAM problem in a safe way, seeing all the moving parts of it, and working towards larger scale prevention based on that knowledge. i.e. - Understanding what platforms are being exploited by predators and pressuring relevant people managing that platform to implement specific and achievable change, like scanning illegal codewords and blocking them, and reporting the user's information to authorities.

This is in contrast to what is legally described as "vigilantism" across the internet. - This is a new legal and safe version that we want to make available to everyone who has been traumatized by the seemingly infinite amount of child exploitation on every social platform. 
#### 'Vigilantism'

There is a secret community of people online who are constantly behind the scenes reporting child predators. (Their work goes beyond that - a lot of them Doxx, and harass predators - I consider it the 'dirty work' within the great fight against exploitation - and it is almost always traumatic.

This is legally known as "vigilantism" and is informally known as "pedo hunting/reporting".

I want us to always remember this part of our community - And help them have access to resources as well, and work towards encouraging better methods of fighting exploitation. (Such as, our [Daisykorps](https://www.endce.org/daisykorps) idea)

#### Minors taking responsibility

Since there are tons of minors using the internet right now, we're going to encourage the safest possible use of the internet - We encourage anyone under 18 to take responsibility for their safety since it's the right thing to do. We also have developed (and are improving) a [process for reporting](https://www.endce.org/reporting-checklist) to make sure we get the most results from reporting online (child) exploitation.

We're not going to treat you like a little kid if you can take responsibility and put some effort into safety.
#### Helping paedophiles & porn addicts to prove that humans can go from hell to being an amazing person.

Finding users of depraved and illegal porn in places across the internet and giving them whatever [[Resources/Porn Addiction - Sexual Temptation\|resources]] needed to ensure that they can change their behaviours and fight the demand & desire for child sexual exploitation material in the process. We can separate CE interest from the person experiencing it and recognise deeper causes, like depression, (porn) addiction, trauma. We will always extend care towards these people, in the hopes that a very small amount of them will take steps to change - and based on the fact that the world is multi-variant and complex, change IS actually possible among some of these people, as we have seen with our project before!

We believe that CSAM is only desired because of a lack of freedom within a person, a dependency on sexual urges - The theme of deeply rooted dependency and addiction is common throughout anything relating to child sexual abuse. - Like how a dependency on industrial cities can lead to sex trafficking. We are making that connection, and solving this problem based on these connections.
#### Main method for advertising:

People who are wasting time online see the [[Home\|homepage]], and see the most straightforward & simple guide for solving problems.

If they choose to help us directly, they will be asked to pick a core task of importance (researching, writing, making media, staff) and build up that skill by working with us.

Then, they leave after contributing time, hopefully having developed a new skill, contributed to stopping exploitation, and feeling fulfilled.

People of all kinds join our project, and can contribute resources and information that has helped them to our [resource collection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCpQcEDN4LpNK6ITnIlqadyR673-eKCbEWiBRfKQB4A/edit?usp=sharing), then, we hopefully help and encourage more people.
