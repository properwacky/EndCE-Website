# What We Do 🌍️

## Our modern world is enabling mass child exploitation, and we have to do something about it.

You're indirectly or directly affected by it (possibly even traumatized from it) - everyday, tons of people [send and sell CSAM] while exploiting countless kids with no consequences, with [CSAM](https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/csam), and all kinds of [CE](https://safeguarding.network/content/safeguarding-resources/child-criminal-exploitation/) being enabled and normalized.

Horrible, right? Don't worry, it's only solutions from now on. Let's do something about this together.
## The Project 🎯

We are a small internet group focused on stopping child exploitation with fun and creative methods. The goal is to fill up all of the useless and nasty parts of the internet with eye-opening content like this for people who care about mental health and children. **We will win this battle against evil, we already are.** 

### We're here to share this message in a simple, honest, and life loving, non corporate way.
