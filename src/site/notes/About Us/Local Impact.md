# Local Impact 📍

Eager to change the world? Let's start with local impact. This doesn't have to be directly about our project, just about being a good human.

## You could:

- Share a letter of concern for parents
- Volunteer for food banks, charities, etc.
- Print out posters and stick them up in public areas (with permission, of course)
- Use the [[Resources/Shareable Content\|shareable's]] to make your friends laugh

## Printables

- *[Print out, rewrite in your own words, or copy](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/9cXPdAH1+O3A4h6O9lv-UrTl/)*
- *[A poster](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/5gTqIryFplEtajM6JMkI8nY9/)*
- *[Handout](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/TuShpBvd54aMPGxK3saJ0CyO/)*

> Use a public library if you don't own a printer. Or, ask to use a friends.
