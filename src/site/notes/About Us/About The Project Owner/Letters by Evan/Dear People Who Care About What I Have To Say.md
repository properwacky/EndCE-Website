# A Letter

`Jan 2025`

Dear people who care about what I have to say,

I am asking you to consider making changes that benefit everyone and the Earth.

All the problems of our time seem SO overwhelming — so we don't even try in some areas. It's not like we can change anything right??

That's where I hope you see that you're wrong.

Everyone is increasingly dependent on companies in governments - people put all their trust into them. But whether it's through actual sociopaths who want money, or flawed systems who have responsibilities and obligations to do immoral practices, trusting big organizations like this doesn't seem to be a long term option. In the world created, there is endless waste. Disgusting single-use plastic is everywhere. (We can recycle and put a little bit of effort into fighting that, tho) All medicine is held by the “authority” that people trust. The default school system has endless flaws, but why is it still as blindly accepted as it is? The products that we use have questionable origins, but how much change are you actually willing to make happen?

I feel hopeless mentioning these problems, because you already know them! You know all of them! Yet, these things persist.

I'd say we should start developing some values in our personal lives that show a good example to others. I'm thinking:

Sustainability (slowly make everything we do into something long term, natural, and good for the Earth)

Sacrifice (Putting aside our ego and comfort just a bit while we throw out everything in our life that makes things worse)

Imagine if our lives are a beautiful example for how to care for the Earth and people. Imagine if we control our lives. This is our purpose that we can all work together towards. Sounds kinda cliché, but it's the solution I'm thinking of.

So, why can't we do this? Why not?

I hope it's not because we are too busy. We should never allow ourselves to be too busy to care about life. 

Why can't being rich just be living a meaningful, conscientious, thankful life?

I have implemented things in my own life that I believe are saving the world on an individual scale. Please reach out to me if we could work together on this. I value your thoughts and ideas. We can't afford anymore infighting and blaming the wrong enemies.

I am currently preparing for the great sacrifice in my own life, where I will find a community who cares about growing food and everything good I've mentioned. As I walk towards this life every day, I see how rich it is. When I see others who don't have this same joy, I feel it is my responsibility to at least tell them about this amazing thing. There is hope and I have seen it personally.

If I've made you feel like a bad person or something, then I have failed. There is good in every human life. I just want us to let the good shine fully, and understand and control the evil parts of us.

Also, here's a couple good things to start doing:

-Change up your YouTube feed to get recommended more videos that align with your purpose. Useful and good stuff.

-There's a [[Resources/Mental Health Tools for Everyone\|page on this website]] full of 'good things'

-Take baby steps

“Learn to love without consuming?”

Thank you for caring about reading this.
