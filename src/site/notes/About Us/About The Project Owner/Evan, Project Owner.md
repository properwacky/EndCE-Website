# Evan, Project Owner ðŸŒº

>Name: Evan/Evels/Evalyne
>Age: 20
>True American ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Basically... I just have some strict and 'no nonsense' beliefs about stuff. I believe that parents have absolutely no excuse to let their children be exploited online. Maybe handing a toddler a phone when you don't want to parent them is kind of... cringe? Maybe I'm just cringe. Wow, it's so weird being my truly sperggy authentic self on this formal-ish website.

Anyway, yeah, I made all this.

I have pages and pages of notes for this project. I've put a lot of time into it, I do it because:

- It offers me a chance to do something that feels productive, although I dont truly know if im changing the world yet.
- It offers me an opportunity to write and journal in a fun way.
- A chance to try to be a leader.

My favorite things to do with this project are:

Understand pedophilia and porn addiction, motives and demons behind abusers, and develop useful skills likeÂ deep work, mindfulness, and my own [[About Us/About The Project Owner/Character Traits\|character traits]] :)

I basically just consume endless amounts of skill-building content, and art, and put in endless amounts of work that I feel may have a good effect later on. I really am operating with the long term in mind here. I think back in 2019 my family's computers got taken and we got investigated because I made up a fake child victim to lure predators to send their Mega.nz links which we then email to mega to get them taken down. Funny stuff. It's good to know that the predators we've seen online do actually get justice.

It's currently 3am for me. Just... goodnight. Thank you for being a part of this great project if you are a part of it.

Some random stuff about me as I continue to edit this about-me:

My first chosen name, Evelyn - means "Island" and "Desired" - I am desired it seems!! What an incredible gift that is. "It is important to feel needed"

I don't know what the island part means just yet but I think I am destined to go to an island one day.

But I don't think any of that tells the full story of what my name means. My name is a representation of a person who always searches for good in life. A new-ish person who took everything good from the old version of me, to become the best version of me.
