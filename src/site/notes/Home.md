## In Short

We are a small internet group focused on stoppingÂ child exploitation with fun and creative methods.Â The goal is toÂ fill up all of the useless and nasty parts of the internet with eye-opening content for people who care about mental health and children. **We will win this battle against evil, we already are.**

## How can I help?

You can volunteer with us! We have a lovely community on [Discord](https://linktr.ee/wheatfarms) that you can join and offer some help. 

If you're really keen, you could make resources, researching how to prevent escalation, or put up posters in your local area.

We have many jobs you could be getting on with. Just join the Discord and create a ticket, someone will be in touch with a job.
## I don't want to join the Discord. What can I do to help anyway?

We have talented people making [[Resources/Shareable Content\|shareable's]] that you can post online. We encourage you to make your own, too!

Use `#shareyourstory` online to help create awareness.
