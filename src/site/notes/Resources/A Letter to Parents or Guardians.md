# A Letter to Parents or Guardians ðŸ’Œ

Dear caring parent or guardian,

There is an epidemic of online child exploitation. The internet is the modern wild-west, where everything goes and nothing is regulated. This unfortunately brings a risk to your children.

Simply put, we must disarm predators and the technology that allows exploitation to be mainstream.

We recommend not letting your child use the internet until they show responsibility. Educate them on the dangers and show them it's not out of pure defiance. The internet is a very dangerous place. We should be grateful for our naivety, however this doesn't stop horrors like child pornography and exploitation from happening. 

We have to fight this as a community. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. You are a caring person that truly cares for safety of children on the internet. It takes one person to change the world.

with love from the EndCE Team
