# Why it's important to escape 🏕️

> by [[Evan, Project Owner\|Evan, Project Owner]] 

Simply... We should do anything it takes to create an environment that is as safe as possible for people, mentally and physically even if it means changing EVERYTHING. 

I am saying it's probably best to move yourself and/or your family off grid, into a situation where you are not dependent on dangerous cities, and long term mental health damage that occurs when people live in dependency (on companies, addictions, excessive government rule) and around crime, and in fear, and under tyrannical rule, and without nature.

This way of life looks different for different people obviously, but the idea is independence, community, and a place where an individual can be truly safe, and truly flourish mentally.
## The Technology Side

It's extremely easy for children to be exploited online. This is a point that's well known. The modern world is highly dependent on devices with internet connection. Obviously there are endless dangers such as [grooming](https://safekidsthrive.org/the-report/introduction/other-warning-signs/) and extortion and information stealing, among other things. As technology gets more advanced, it becomes harder to manage keeping children safe online. (Although keeping them safe can definitely still be done) - At the current time of writing this, posting a simple photo of a child online can be dangerous, as it can be used to train AI to generate [fake child pornography or deepfake porn.](https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/55926/1/inside-the-disturbing-rise-of-deepfake-porn) That's not really something you or I can control, but gaining independence from these technologies should probably be a long-term focus, right? 

## Dependency

Being dependent on governments is not a long-term solution for humans. Our society requires us to pay endless money and live entirely under the control of companies and governments, such a life comes with obvious mental health damage. This is not to say: Rebel against the government and disobey laws, but rather: Have the option to be free of possible tyrannical actions by governments. This is keeping the future in mind for children and family and human life.

## Danger of Cities

Kidnapping, rape, trafficking, among other evil things, all occur from the opportunity that our high-population cities offer.

The point can be made that people are kind of supposed to live in close-knit and smaller communities anyway.

# How to escape

## Learning Skills

Easily the most important thing. Use the internet to learn any kind of sustainability skill relevant to where you live on Earth.

It's easier and more fun than you might think.

We have some resources for having a healthy and less dependent life.

## Knowledge is Power

Basically - Make a rough plan. It's probably not worth it to just live away from all modern inventions like cameras and music and those actually good things. But being free from the main dangers is worth it.

This is not meant to make you feel depressed, but rather, to encourage you. 

It CAN be done. With an understanding of living sustainably in any way that serves you best. You can master and learn the basics, and try to get as many people to live freely as possible. I truly believe that living in nature, sustainably, somehow.. would be the absolute best thing to prevent child exploitation. (And infinite other problems)

When you examine the society you live in, do you find a lot of problems? How many things do you see that a man has built, that can harm children?

You don't have to do it alone. 

I think... if you're even on this site for this long, you should desire true change in the world. 

Why WOULDN'T you want to be independent and have a truly good environment to live in, or for your family to live in?

Thank you for reading this. 

Would this be a good Idea? I am currently beginning it in my own life. Even practising this kind of thing partially is absolutely amazing.

## Writer's notes

This is the main gift I want to bring to the world - an easy and understandable guide for building a truly free life this way. I believe this is a simple and honest approach to solving a lot of problems in our world, and it just solves so so many problems all in one. We offer other resources because everyone is different., even though I wish everyone could think like this and read this. Please tell me if I am wrong or if this is not a good idea. I am building this kind of life for myself and a few others.
